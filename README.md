## 🤖 AI Usage

Built with **Claude (Anthropic)**:
- Designed the full UI/UX — layout, dark theme, color system, typography
- Scaffolded the SPA with auth, routing, and all views
- Built the Express backend with SQLite schema and REST API
- Integrated OpenRouter AI with user-personalized system prompts
- Wrote Vercel + Railway deployment configs
- Generated this README

**Built/decided without AI:**
- Product requirements and feature decisions
- Choosing the tech stack (Node + SQLite + OpenRouter)
- Selecting Vercel, Railway, and OpenRouter as platforms
- Reviewing, testing, and debugging all generated code
- Deployment and configuration
